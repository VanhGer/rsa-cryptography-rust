# RSA Implementation with Rust-lang

## Compile and Run
To just build the binary:
```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in `target/release/rsa-implementation-rust`
You can copy it to another directory with
```sh
$ cp target/release/rsa-implementation-rust ./rsa-rust
```
And then run it from there by doing
```sh
$ ./rsa-rust
```
The cli interface will guide you on how to use the avaiable subcommands

## The math of RSA encryption

### Public and Private key generation
1. Select two big prime numbers `P` and `Q`
1. Calculate `N = P * Q`
1. Calculate `位(N) = (P-1) * (Q-1)`
1. Find a `E` such that `gcd(e, 位(N)) = 1` and `1 < E < 位(N)`
1. Calculate `D` such that `E*D = 1 (mod 位(N))`

- The Public key will be `(N, E)`
- The Private key will be `(N, D)`

### Encryption and Decryption
Given a message `M` and a ciphered message `C`

#### Encryption
- Given the message `M` use <code>M<sup>E</sup> = C (mod N)</code> to calculate the ciphered message `C`

#### Decryption
- Given the ciphered message `C` use <code>C<sup>D</sup> = M (mod N)</code> to calculate the original message `M`
